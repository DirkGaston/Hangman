**Hangman** is a simple, interactive game developed as a fun way to learn and practice React. This project is a basic implementation of the classic hangman game where you guess the word by choosing letters.

## Project Background üìñ

Hangman was created as a small exercise to demonstrate basic React skills. It's a simple, yet entertaining way to understand the fundamentals of React components, state management, and event handling.

The game features:

A random word generator.
On-screen keyboard for letter selection.
Visual display of the hangman as wrong guesses are made.
Victory or defeat messages based on the player's performance.
